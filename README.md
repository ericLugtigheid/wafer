Sketchup plugin to export g-code

I first created this script back in September 2010 to make use of a little CNC mill i'd built out of broken printers and MDF. Sometime shortly afterward i forgot about it until somone contacted me recently with questions and bug fixes.
Since it turns out there are a few users out there, let's fix it up a bit.
